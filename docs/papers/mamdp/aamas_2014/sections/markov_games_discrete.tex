\section{Discrete Stochastic Games}
\label{sec:dsg}

Discrete state stochastic games (DSGs) are formally defined by the tuple \\
$ \left\langle S, A_{1 \ldots n}, T, R_{1 \ldots n} \right\rangle $.
$S$ is a set of discrete states and $A_i$ is the action set available to agent $i$. 
$A$ represents the joint action space 
$ A_1 \times \ldots \times A_n $. T is a transition function 
$T : S \times A \rightarrow \Delta$ where $\Delta$ is the set of 
probability distributions over the state space $S$. The reward function
$R_i : S \times A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ encodes the preferences
agent $i$. In a stochastic game a policy $\pi : S \rightarrow \sigma(A)$ 
yields probability
distributions over the agent's actions for each state in $S$. As a result,
the optimal policy in a stochastic game may be stochastic. The goal of 
each agent in a stochastic game is to maximise its expected 
discounted future rewards.

Zero-sum discrete stochastic games impose a condition on the reward
structure of the game, whereby the goals of each agent are diametrically
opposed to one another. Under this restriction, the game can be expressed
using a single reward function. Each agent attempts to 
maximise its expected discounted future rewards in the minimax sense.
Zero-sum stochastic games can be solved using a technique analogous
to value iteration in MDPs \cite{Littman_ICML_1994}. Under this view
the value of a state \emph{s} in a stochastic game is 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dsgvfunc}
  V^{h}(s) = \max_{\pi_{a_1} \in \sigma(A_1)}\min_{\pi_{a_2} \in \sigma(A_2)} \sum_{a_1 \in A_1} \sum_{a_2 \in A_2} Q^{h}(s, a_1, a_2) \cdot \pi_{a_1} \cdot \pi_{a_2},
\end{equation}

where $a_i$ is an action from $A_i$ and $\pi_{a_i}$ is a policy defined 
over the probability distributions of $A_i$.  It is well known that 
Equation \ref{eq:dsgvfunc} can be further simplified to
%by considering that in a zero-sum game 
%the opponent will act to minimise the agent's return. Thus the value
%function can be re-written as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dsgvfunccompact}
  V^{h}(s) = \max_{\pi_{a_1} \in \sigma(A_1)} \min_{a_2 \in A_2} \sum_{a_1 \in A_1} Q^{h}(s, a_1, a_2) \cdot \pi_{a_1}.
\end{equation}

The value of taking action $a_1$ against action $a_2$ in state $s$ is given by

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dsgdiscqfunc}
  Q^{h}(s, a_1, a_2) = R(s, a_1, a_2) + \gamma \sum_{s' \in S} T(s, a_1, a_2, s') V^{h-1}(s'). \\
\end{equation}

The value function for the opponent can be calculated by applying symmetric
reasoning and the Minimax theorem \cite{Neumann_MA_1928}. 

\subsection{Solution Techniques}
\label{subsec:dsgsolution}

The value function shown in Equation \ref{eq:dsgvfunccompact} can be solved for each
$s \in S$ by reformulating it as the following linear optimisation problem:

\begin{align*}
\text{maximise}   & \qquad V^{h}(s) \\
\text{subject to}   & \qquad \pi_{a_1} \geq 0 \qquad \forall a_1 \in A_1 \\
                          & \qquad \sum_{a_1 \in A_1} \pi_{a_1} = 1 \\
                          & \qquad V^{h}(s) \leq \sum_{a_1 \in A_1} Q^{h}(s, a_1, a_2) \cdot \pi_{a_1} \qquad \forall a_2 \in A_2
\end{align*}

We note that two transformations have been applied in the 
reformulation process. Firstly, we define $V(s)$ to be
$ \min_{a_2 \in A_2} \sum_{a_1 \in A_1} Q^{h}(s, a_1, a_2) \cdot \pi_{a_1}$,
the value of the inner minimisation. Secondly, we note that the minimum
of a set is less than or equal to the minimum of all elements in the set, 
that is $V(s) = \min_{a_2 \in A_2} \sum_{a_1 \in A_1} Q^{h}(s, a_1, a_2) \cdot \pi_{a_1} \equiv V(s) \leq  \sum_{a_1 \in A_1} Q^{h}(s, a_1, a_2) \cdot \pi_{a_1} \quad \forall a_2 \in A_2$.

%We begin the reformulation process replacing the equality operator with 
%the inequality $\leq$. Both operators are equivalent when performed
%within a $max$ operator.
%The $min$ operator can then be expanded 
%to a series of linear constraints, one for each $a_2 \in A_2$. 

%In the next section we illustrate we can use this reformulation as the basis
%for solutions to continuous state Zero-sum stochastic games.
