We evaluated Robust SDP on the \textsc{Reservoir Control} problem used as a running example,
a \textsc{UAV Navigation} problem  and
a \textsc{Space Telescope Control} problem --- all highly risk-sensitive and uncertain
decision-making problems as described below.\footnote{We 
note that all Java source code and a
human/machine readable file format for all domains needed to reproduce

Figure \ref{fig:Value} (left) shows the value function for the
\textsc{Reservoir Control} problem in horizon seven. We can observe
that we can gain approximately 11000 units of reward if the reservoir
begins with a water level approximately equal to 3000 at day zero.
Otherwise, a lower initial starting state or the need to drain when
the reservoir is near full lead to lower rewards for all states.
Discontinuities in the value function occur at critical points where
the policy changes over the time horizon.

%{\bf \textsc{Reservoir Control}:} Reservoir management is a well-studied in
%OR~\cite{Mahootchi2009,Yeh1985}.  In this domain we decided between
%\emph{drain} (or \emph{not drain}) each reservoir to maximize
%electricity revenue over the decision-stage horizon while avoiding
%reservoir overflow and underflow.

%We solve a 2-reservoir problem with
%levels $(l_1,l_2)\in [0,\infty]^2$ with reward penalties for
%overflow and underflow and a reward gain of 1, i.e.:


%{\footnotesize
%\begin{align*}
%R & = \begin{cases}
%(l_1 \leq 4500) \wedge (l_2 \leq 4500) \wedge (l_1 \geq 200) \wedge (l_2 \geq 200) &:1\\
%else &: -\infty\\
%\end{cases}
%\end{align*}}


%The electricity is generated in periods when the $\mathit{drain}()$ action
%drains water from $l_2$ to $l_1$, the other action is
%$\mathit{no}$-$\mathit{drain}()$); we assume a daily control,  four days are wet and the next four days are dry (we use three discrete variables to %count the day $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_3$), the rainfall
%replenishment depends on that and is modeled by the noise:
%{\footnotesize
%\begin{align*}
%n & = \begin{cases}
%(d_1) \wedge (n \leq 2000) \wedge (n \geq 1200) &:legal\\
%\neg (d_1) \wedge (n \leq 400) \wedge (n \geq 0) &:legal\\
%else &: illegal\\
%\end{cases}
%\end{align*}}


%The transition function for levels of the $\mathit{drain}$ action are
%{\footnotesize
%\begin{align*}
%l_1' & =(n + l_1 - 2800 + 2000) \\
%l_2'& =(n + l_2 - 2000)
%\end{align*}}
%while for $\mathit{no}$-$\mathit{drain}$ action, the $\mathit{2000}$ term is dropped.

{\bf \textsc{Space Telescope Control}:} We have extended the problem
of slewing a space telescope in order to look a new objective as given
in \cite{DLohr:2012}. This problem has six actions $a_0, \cdots ,a_5$
that change the continuous angle $k$ and angular rate $v$.  The
problem has one boolean state variable $z$ for the telescope zoom
state, one $g$ for reaching the goal state, and one continuous noise
variable.  To model noise in this problem, we have only modified the
transition function for the $a_5$ action in the description
from~\cite{DLohr:2012} (which could not handle noise) to add noise
$n$ when $v < 1$ $\frac{deg}{seg}$ and $z=false$ yielding state
updates for $a_5$ as follows: {\footnotesize
\begin{align*}
k' & =( k + 40.55*v) \\
v'& =(2/3 v + n) \\
z'& =( true ),
\end{align*}}
We model the noise in the transition function of the angular
velocity $v$ for $a_5$ (which changes the zoom of the telescope and for which
the dynamical model is only approximate) as follows:
{\footnotesize
\begin{align*}
n & = \begin{cases}
\neg (z) \wedge (n \leq 0.04*v) \wedge (n \geq -0.04*v) &:-\infty\\
else &: +\infty\\
\end{cases}
\end{align*}}
where we note that noise depends linearly on the angular velocity.

The reward for actions $a_0, \cdots ,a_5$ is given by
{\tiny
\begin{align*}
R & = \begin{cases}
(z) \wedge (v \! \leq \! 0.02) \wedge (k \! \leq \! 1.683) \wedge (v \! \geq \! -0.02) \wedge (k \! \geq \! 1.283) &\!\!:100\\
else &: -\mathit{cost}(a)\\
\end{cases}
\end{align*}}
where the $\mathit{cost}(a)$ of action $a_0$ is 0, $1$ for actions
$a_i$ $i \in \{1,2,3,4\}$ and $10$ for action $a_5$.  
Figure \ref{fig:Value} (middle) shows the value function for the
horizon four. We observe there are states with low angular
rate (approximately $-0.04\leq v \leq 0.04$) that have a policy to
achieve a goal (a reward of 100) with high certainty over this
horizon.

{\bf \textsc{UAV Navigation}:}
In this problem a UAV needs to be able to plan trajectories that take
the aircraft from its current location to a goal given constraints on
time or fuel consumption and known areas of state-dependent turbulence
(e.g., from localized weather events).

The state consists of a UAV´s continuous position $x$ and $y$ and a
boolean variable $l$ indicating whether it has landed.  In a given
time step, the UAV may move a continuous distance $a_x \in [-40,40]$
and $a_y \in [-40,40]$. The turbulence introduces noise $n_x$ and
$n_y$ in the $a_x$ and $a_y$ movements, given by: {\footnotesize
\begin{align*}
n_x & = \begin{cases}
(y \geq 50 + x) \wedge (n_x \leq -20) \wedge (n_x \geq 20) &:-\infty\\
(y < 50 + x) \wedge (n_x \leq -5) \wedge (n_x \geq 5) &:-\infty\\
else &: +\infty\\
\end{cases}\\
n_y & = \begin{cases}
(y \geq 50 + x) \wedge (n_y \leq -20) \wedge (n_y \geq 20) &:-\infty\\
(y < 50 + x) \wedge (n_y \leq -5) \wedge (n_y \geq 5) &:-\infty\\
else &: +\infty\\
\end{cases}
\end{align*}}
The UAV goal is to achieve the region $x+y > 200$. It receives a
reward penalty ($-\infty$) for being in positions from which a UAV
with a given amount of fuel reserves cannot return to its landing
strip with high certainty. 
%added
{\footnotesize
\begin{align*}
R & = \begin{cases}
(l) \wedge (x \leq 130) \wedge (y \leq 130) \wedge (x \geq 0) \wedge (y \geq 0) & \!\! :0\\
(\neg l) \wedge (x \leq 130) \wedge (y \leq 130) \wedge (x \geq 0) \wedge (y \geq 0) & \!\! :-20\\
else &: -\infty\\
\end{cases}
\end{align*}}
If the UAV is not in the goal position ($\neg l$), the action
reward is a cost of -20 fuel units for the given time period.  We note that
with six continuous variables in the regression (2 state, 2 action, 2 noise),
this problem is relatively high-dimensional and could not be easily solved
via discretization methods, which also incur approximation error not encountered
in our exact solution provided here.

Figure \ref{fig:Value} (right) shows the \emph{converged} value
function for a horizon of four time steps showing the 
relative cost of returning to the landing strip from different
positions with lower values near high levels of turbulence.

\textbf{Time and Space:} Figure \ref{fig:SpaceTime} shows the time and
space for each of the solved problems.  The \textsc{UAV Navigation}
problem has more continuous variables, however we can see that it is
easier to solve than the \textsc{Space Telescope Control}, one
possible reason is that the latter has more actions with more
complex forms of linearly state dependent noise.
