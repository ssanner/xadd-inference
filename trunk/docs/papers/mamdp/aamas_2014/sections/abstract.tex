Zero-sum stochastic games provide a formalism to study competitive 
sequential interactions between two agents with diametrically opposing goals and evolving state.
A solution to such games in the case of a discrete environment, or state, 
was presented by Littman \cite{Littman_ICML_1994}. The continuous state case, 
however, remains unsolved. In many instances this requires nonlinear 
parameterised optimisation, a problem for which closed-form solutions 
are generally unavailable. We characterise a subclass of continuous 
stochastic games and present
a novel symbolic dynamic programming method which enables these
problems to be reduced to a parameterised linear program, for which
an exact closed-form solution exists. The method is used to compute 
exact solutions to a variety of continuous state zero-sum stochastic games.
